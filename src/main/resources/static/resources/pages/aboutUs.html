    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>www.BizRealWorth.com is dedicated to helping Small Business Community all over US, to measure the RealWorth&trade; of their business or business they want to purchase.</p>
    
    <p>Running a successful Small Business is cpmbination of Art and Science, some of you have already mastered the business domain and some of you are just exploring the idea. While you are perfecting the art, let us help you with the science part of it. Especially the Data Science part of it!</p>
    
    <P>We started with the premise that world is heading or rather hurtling towards digitalization. Big Data companies like Google and Facebook now have approximately 1000 data points for every individual. What else they have is about 100 socio-economical data points about every Business(like business details, community and city attributes, demographics, various economic factors, social behavioral patterns related to consumption of food and goods, income levels, crime levels etc)</p>

    <p>We are gathering all this data from multiple sources(data mining) mapping and organizing it(data curation) and then overlaying and analyzing it(data analytics) This is helping us to provide our customers different dimensions to extract business intelligence to succeed.</p>

    <p>Once we collect enough crical data points to identify patterns about business activities we are applying our Trade Marked Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the RealWorth&trade; of the Business!</p>
    
    <p>This service is launched on 05/10/2020, in the midst of COVID-19 when humanity is strugling to fight the pandemic. As part of the recovery from this situation one of the most significant steps governments all over the US are taking is to substancially help Small Business Community. This is an acknowladgement of SMB as a backbone of Financial as well as Social fabric of American Way of Life!</p>
    
    <p>Human ingenuity ultimately always prevails these kind of difficult times! We are in this together and we will come out bigger and better! But it’s now important more than ever to make sure we get worth of every penny we spend in business.</p>
    
    <p>www.BizRealWorth.com is here to help you gain trust and confidence in the financial dealings about Business Buy, Sells, Mergers and Acquisitions.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to empower Small Business Community or Main Street USA by the means of digitization of information and advancement in data collection and data processing technologies like Data Mining, Digital Transformations, AI and ML.</p>

    <p>Our innovative self evolving algorithm that is named RealWorth&trade; can help you know more about businesses in the area where you are doing business, or thinking of starting business or selling business and can help you visualize the true potential or Real Worth of the opportunity!</p>

    <p>Right before our eyes, nearly every aspect of our lives is rapidly evolving, so much so that it is difficult to keep up. This rapid evolution presents opportunities for us to examine where we have come from, assess where we want to go, and redefine ourselves as Business.</p>

    <p>Business Valuation used to be the domain of big public companies. It was technically complex. It had high up-front costs and it’s expensive. All this made it impractical for Main Street Mom and Pop stores and smaller companies to get professional valuation done.</p>

    <p>RealWorth&trade; changes all of that.</p>

    <p>Our data is complete, verified, processed through multiple AI and ML algorithms to make sure it’s curated with the strict rules of Data Science!</p>

    <p>We started in the premises that the world is going towards digitization, every business is unique while much of the data about business is already out there in public domain and being sold and bought for many other purposes except to help the very business and business owners behind that data.</p>

    <p>We are trying to make it worth a while for businesses to share this information to help each other making better decisions in their everyday business life!</p>

    <p>On the surface our approach and concept looks very similarly different ball game!</p>

    <p>The value of a business opportunity depends on various factors and it changes dramatically based on changes to these factors. Some of those could be geographical, economical, political or even seasonal.</p>

    <p>Even the reputation and goodwill matters!</p>

    <p>We are striving to build a service that we keep on running for perfection so we predict the most appropriate value with most accurate and up to date data available and technically possible.</p>

    <p>That’s where the AI and ML come into picture!</p>

    <p>We are a small group of software engineers turned entrepreneurs with combine experiences of 40 years of software engineering, and 10 years of small business ownership.</p>

    <p>We decided to help the small business community with clear vision in mind to help someone who is trying to start or have something of her or his own by giving them insight to what it took others to get to the point where they are today and give them vital insights of the business environment from the micro or macro market where they are trying to start or to someone who is trying to sell and looking for exit plan.</p>
