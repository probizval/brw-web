    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>www.BizRealWorth.com is dedicated to helping Small Business Community all over US, to measure the 
    RealWorth&trade; of business they own or business they want to purchase.</p>
    
    <p>Running a successful Small Business is combination of Art and Science, some of you have already mastered the 
    business domain and some of you are just exploring the idea. While you are perfecting the art, 
    let us help you with the science part of it. Especially the Data Science part of it!</p>
    
    <P>We started with the premise that world is heading or rather hurling towards digitalization. Big Data companies 
    like Google and Facebook now have approximately 1000 data points for every individual. What else they have is 
    about 100 socio-economical data points about every Business(like business details, community and city attributes, 
    demographics, various economic factors, social behavioral patterns related to consumption of food and goods, 
    income levels, crime levels etc). We are gathering all this data from multiple sources(data mining) mapping and 
    organizing it(data curation) and then overlaying and analyzing it(data analytics) This is helping us to provide 
    our customers different dimensions to extract business intelligence to succeed. Once we collect enough critical data points to identify patterns about business activities we are applying our 
    Trade Marked Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the RealWorth&trade; of 
    the Business!</p>
    
    <p>This service is launched on 05/10/2020, in the midst of COVID-19 when humanity is struggling to fight the 
    pandemic. As part of the recovery from this situation one of the most significant steps governments all over the 
    US are taking is to substantially help Small Business Community. This is an acknowledgement of SMB as a backbone 
    of Financial as well as Social fabric of American Way of Life! Human ingenuity ultimately always prevails these 
    kind of difficult times! We are in this together and we will come out bigger and better! But it’s now important 
    more than ever to make sure we get worth of every penny we spend in business.</p>
    
    <p>www.BizRealWorth.com is here to help you gain trust and confidence in the financial dealings about Business 
    Buy, Sells, Mergers and Acquisitions. Our goal is to empower Small Business Community or Main Street USA by the 
    means of digitization of information and advancement in data collection and data processing technologies like 
    Data Mining, Digital Transformations, AI and ML. Our innovative self evolving algorithm that is named 
    RealWorth&trade; can help you know more about businesses in the area where you are doing business, or thinking 
    of starting business or selling business and can help you visualize the true potential or Real Worth of the 
    opportunity!</p>

    <p>Right before our eyes, nearly every aspect of our lives is rapidly evolving, so much so that it is difficult 
    to keep up. This rapid evolution presents opportunities for us to examine where we have come from, assess 
    where we want to go, and redefine ourselves as Business. Business Valuation used to be the domain of big public 
    companies. It was technically complex. It had high up-front costs and it’s expensive. All this made it impractical 
    for Main Street Mom and Pop stores and smaller companies to get professional valuation done.</p>

    <p>RealWorth&trade; is looking to change all of that!</p>
